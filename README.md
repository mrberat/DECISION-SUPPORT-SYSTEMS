# DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS
The aim of the project is to maximize staff productivity for a chain fast-food restaurant. For this purpose, a decision support system (DSS) will be used for the regional manager of the restaurant. The DSS, a web-based program, will function as a reporting and analysis system utilizing visualized data for all restaurants under the responsibility of the regional manager. Another feature of the system is the ability for the manager to simulate desired staff productivity scenarios.

The problem arises from the fact that employees in such chain food restaurants do not work for long periods in the restaurant they entered to work. As resignations come within a timeframe of 3-6 months, the continuity of the business is jeopardized. Therefore, personnel transfers between businesses of this kind are made. However, if these transfers are made without data and without consciousness, the business may incur losses in the long term. The project will provide a solution to this problem.

The method used in the project is to create a web-based decision support system. The KDS will fetch data from the created database in real-time. It will generate graphs with relevant data, calculate density based on mathematical operations, and report to the manager. The manager will be able to create scenarios using this system in the analysis section.

The software used in the project is as follows:

MySQL
NodeJS
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
JavaScript
The coding phase of the project was done using modular systems. The database was designed relationally, and the server part was coded according to the MVC structure. The site was designed to be simple and efficient, taking into account the manager's ease of adaptation and use.
